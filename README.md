# Three-Phase-Rectifier---MATLAB Simulink
For the Simulation of a Three Phase Fully Controlled Rectifier with C filter on RLE Load.
A MATLAB Simulink model created with a 230V , 50 Hz , Three phase supply connected to 6 thyristors, whose gate ports are connected to 6 seperate pulse generators with zero firing angles with the details defined in the simulink model.
The output from the thyristors are connected to a RLE load filtered with a Capacitor.
The output RMS and Average values are calculated and Efficiency of the output along with the Totla Harmonic Distortion is displayed for the Performance of the Converter.
